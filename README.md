# Unrated
Unrated is a chrome extension for hiding all traces of numeric scores/letter grades from review sites. This includes not only the ratings themselves, but also links to "best of" sections (e.g. Pitchfork's "Best New Music" or "8.0+" sections) and options to sort by rating.

### "Uh, why??"
My own laziness. I caught myself simply checking the numeric score on music reviews without reading the actual article more often than not. When I got around to actually listening to the release, that nearly-arbitrary score tended to influence my opinion in a big way (more often than I'd like to admit). Once I figured out how to remove the ratings, I started experimenting with removing/modifying other related elements.

### "Gotcha. Which sites does it work on?"
So far:
- [The A.V. Club](http://www.avclub.com/)
- [Gamespot](http://www.gamespot.com/)
- [Pitchfork](http://pitchfork.com/)
- [Resident Advisor](http://www.residentadvisor.net/)
- [XLR8R](http://www.xlr8r.com/)

With many more planned.

### "Are the changes noticeable?"
Shouldn't be! Great care has been taken to ensure that all removed/hidden elements don't inadvertantly alter the rest of the site's functionality or layout.
